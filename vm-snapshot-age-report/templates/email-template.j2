Hello {{ item.name }},

The following VMs have snapshots that are out of date.  Please delete these snapshots as soon as possible:

{% for vm in ( vm_snapshots.json |  json_query("resources[?evm_owner_id == '" + item.id + "']") ) %}
{{ vm.name }}
{% for snapshot in vm.snapshots %}
{% if (snapshot.create_time | to_datetime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')) < (('%Y-%m-%dT%TZ' | strftime((ansible_date_time.epoch|int)-(86400*180))| to_datetime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'))) %}
  - {{ snapshot.name }} - {{ snapshot.create_time | to_datetime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ') }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

While snapshots are very useful for testing purposes, they become problematic the longer the snapshot stays around.

1) When a snapshot is taken it fragments the virtual disk file which can have a detrimental effect on performance. 
2) Older snapshots cause issues with domain membership.
3) Security issues â€“ By reverting to an old snapshot you are re-introducing an unpatched system to the network.

Please delete any old snapshots as soon as possible. 

Kind Regards, 
Cloud Services Team
